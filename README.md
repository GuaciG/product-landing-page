## User story

- [x] **User Story #1:** My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding `id="header"`. 

- [x] **User Story #2:** I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding `id="header-img"`. A company logo would make a good image here. 

- [x] **User Story #3:** Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`.

- [x] **User Story #4:** I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.

- [x] **User Story #5:** When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
 
- [x] **User Story #6:** I can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`.

- [x] **User Story #7:** My landing page has a form element with a corresponding `id="form"`.

- [x] **User Story #8:** Within the form, there is an input field with `id="email"` where I can enter an email address.

- [x] **User Story #9:** The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.

- [x] **User Story #10:** The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.

- [x] **User Story #11:** Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding `id="submit"`.

- [x] **User Story #12:** When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).
